# Eye-Ball-Based-Wheel-Chair-Movement
An efficient mechanism that helps in easy movement for the severely disabled people is given. The main mechanism is in the image acquisition and image processing. The main feature of prototype is that the direction of the wheelchair is decided solely by the patient without stressing himself physically. This can be achieved by the userâ€™s natural gaze using eyeball tracking. The prototype consists of a camera, image acquisition software (OpenCV with python) and a motor controller to drive a wheelchair. Besides being a reliable, convenient and extremely useful this provides best performance and simple solution to latest technology access. The outputs are then used to produce suitable wheelchair motion taking the user to the intended location. The prototype encompasses a critical blend of knowledge and skills and should find high acceptance within the target group of severely disabled, especially whose communications are limited only to eye movements.
